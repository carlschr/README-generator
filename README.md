# README Generator 

  ## Project Description 
  This command line application is used to easily generate a README file with a series of prompts using the inquirer Node Package Module and the file system Node Core Module.

  ## Requirements
  The application must retrieve the following information from the user:
  * Title of the project
  * Project description
  * Usage instructions
  * Contribution instructions
  * Testing instructions
  * Contact information
  * Licensing

  ## Future changes
  I would like to keep improving this project as I learn more about coding and as I learn more about how to create a high-quality README file. I would have used my application to create this file; however, I'm still not sure how the contribution, testing, and usage sections work with a node package application.
